calc_eucdist_from_sync_paired.R is a standalone R script that needs the magrittr package 
(run install.packages('magrittr') in the R console), and two files containing custom functions: 
fs_syncCalculations.R and writeReadSync.R, which are both available at github.com/RetelC/TempDynamics_HostVirCoevol.
